We develop using the latest best practices, including
test-driven and behavior-driven development, rigorous
refactoring and a tight communications loop with our clients.

We use open source tools whenever appropriate so your business
can stand on the shoulders of giants to reach its goals.

Here are a few examples of the kinds of things we can do for you.

- Rapid prototyping using Ruby on Rails and Sinatra
- Building full applications from scratch
- Integrating existing applications with new services
- Code review

We run workshops for business people and development teams
covering:

- Effective project management using agile methods.
- Test-driven and behavior-driven development (TDD & BDD).
- Writing user stories that provide value to the business.

Please [drop us a line](/pages/contact.html) if you have any
questions at all.
